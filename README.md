# genetic-algorithm
This program prints an array of 0s and 1s, where the 1s are positioned to make either diamonds, squares, triangles, or 'houses'. The patterns of 0s and 1s are ranked according to symmetry, complexity, and diversity of shapes. The patterns grow more symmetric, complex, and diverse each time the evolve() method is run.
